Here is my signature work portfolio. The three projects linked below are assignments from CS courses.

https://github.com/ColinHarthorn/TenziLikeGame

https://github.com/ColinHarthorn/Futoshiki

https://github.com/ColinHarthorn/CISC380HW

The first link is to an assignment meant to illustrate the difference between floating point values and doubles.
It is a simple program that repeatedly adds fractions as both types, then prints the results.

The second link is to an assignment where the user can play a game like "Tenzi" involving rolling random dice.
It implements a random dice class and a leaderboard along with the driver to run the game with simple user input.

The last link is to a number puzzle solver. The project represents a "Futoshiki" like game which is similar to sudoku that uses "<" and ">" symbols.
The puzzle solver uses a divide and conquer strategy to solve the puzzles optimally. 
The solver uses "Fork/Join" to recursively solve the puzzle with optimal CPU usage and return the answer.

The last link is to a PDF file of the solution to two graph problems from CISC380. One deals with undirected graphs, and the other with directed graphs.
The solutions are explained in the document, as well as the thought process behind the solutions. The document was produced on Overleaf.com using LaTeX.
This project demonstrates both the solutions to the problems using different algorithms, as well as a proficiency in LaTeX that was used to create the document.
The use of LaTeX was an interesting process in this particular class, The solutions using the algorithms was important, but presenting the information in 
a neat and professional manner was also an important aspect of the class. I gained a proficeincy in using LaTeX which can contribute to me presenting different 
projects and their constituent parts in a slick format. Perhaps I could even use it to create a sequence diagram in the future!
